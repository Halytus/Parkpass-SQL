# Parkpass-SQL
### Bottom Line Up Front
The goal of this assignment was to design a backend database solution to the problem of digitizing the Disney World Resort's Fastpass system. I devised a system that pairs guests' unique ID numbers with all of their existing vacation information such as, the length of their stay, which resort they have booked, which park they have entered, what restaurants they have reserved, and what fastpasses they have booked. The intention behind this is to make the guests experience seamless and invisible, guests should be able to receive their key once and swipe it anywhere that a touchpoint exists to make use of their benefits, enter their room, enter a park, reserve a restaurant or show, and book and consume fastpasses. For the park employees, the guests movements throughout the park should similarly be seamless, with a straightforward structure that should allow them to add or remove permissions for guests upon request.

## Methodology
The design process for a database has roughly five main stages:
1. identifying the problem
2. translating the problem into business needs
3. translating business needs into database functions
4. modeling the database according to the functionss identified in step three
5. writing the SQL that will form the database from your model
